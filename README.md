# SMC0

# Introduction
The purpose of this project was to reverse-engineer a product related to subjects of Sound and Music Computing. We chose to reverse-engineer **Polytune 3**, a guitar tuner pedal from the Danish company TC Electronic.
### Polytune 3
The most interesting feature of the Polytune pedals from TC Electronic is their polyphonic pitch detection, which allows tuning of all strings of the guitar (or other electric string instrument) at once. This feature makes the tuning process a bit faster, and can especially be useful while tuning live on stage between songs.
