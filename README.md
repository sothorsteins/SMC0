# Introduction
The purpose of this project was to reverse-engineer a product related to subjects of Sound and Music Computing. We chose to reverse-engineer **Polytune 3**, a guitar tuner pedal from the Danish company TC Electronic.
### Polytune 3
The most interesting feature of the Polytune pedals from TC Electronic is their polyphonic pitch detection, which allows tuning of all strings of the guitar (or other electric string instrument) at once. This feature makes the tuning process a bit faster, and can especially be useful while tuning live on stage between songs.
# Requirements

The following is a list of non-function and functional requirements the product should meet. The requirement were made based on the functionality, size and price of he Polytuner.  

Non-functional requirements:

1. Detect if one string playing or many strings - automatically switch between interfaces
2. Very quick detection
3. Different interfaces
4. Multiple instruments
5. Affordable
6. Small size
7. Good accuracy
8. Keep the strength of the signal 
9. Should be able to work with standard jack-cables for guitar/bass
10. Working hands-free
11. Visually and quickly be able to see tuning accuracy



Functional requirements:

1. 
    - Do Spectrum analysis to identify Single mode or Polyphonic mode
    - Different tunings (D/G)  for single mode
2. Real time low-latency processing (less than 0.5 s.)
3. Classic tuner in simple mode (needle, horizontal), polyphonic in vertical position 
4. Show 4 verticals for bass, and 6 verticals for guitar
5. Use affordable materials
6. 
    - Small microchip 
    - Fit 2 jack inputs in a smaller space + other hardware stuff
7. 
    - Signal needs to be quite clean (so through jack, not microphone for example)
    - Accuracy of 0.5 cent, although less accurate for polyphonic tuning
8. Bonafide buffering
9. Quarter inch jack for input/output and power supply input
10. Footswitch
11. Color display / green and red diodes
