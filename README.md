# Requirements



Non-functional requirements:
1. Detect if one string playing or many strings - automatically switch between interfaces
2. Very quick detection
3. Different interfaces
4. Multiple instruments
5. Affordable
6. Small size
7. Good accuracy
8. Keep the strength of the signal 
9. Should be able to work with standard jack-cables for guitar/bass
10. Working hands-free
11. Visually and quickly be able to see tuning accuracy




Functional requirements:
1. 
  - Do Spectrum analysis to identify Single mode or Polyphonic mode
  - Different tunings (D/G)  for single mode
2. Real time low-latency processing (less than 0.5 s.)
3. Classic tuner in simple mode (needle, horizontal), polyphonic in vertical position 
4. Show 4 verticals for bass, and 6 verticals for guitar
5. Use affordable materials
6. 
  - Small microchip 
  - Fit 2 jack inputs in a smaller space + other hardware stuff
7. 
  - Signal needs to be quite clean (so through jack, not microphone for example)
  - Accuracy of 0.5 cent, although less accurate for polyphonic tuning
8. Bonafide buffering
9. Quarter inch jack for input/output and power supply input
10. Footswitch
11. Color display / green and red diodes
